# Contributing to this project

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** report issues that are not related to UnityInjector. For issues 
  not related to UnityInjector itself, consider using the following outlets:
  - **The game's own community for quick tech support.** (This is the quickest way to get help!)
  - [BepInEx repository](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) to report issues with
    BepInEx.
  - [SybarisLoader repository](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.SybarisLoader.Patcher) to report issues
    with Sybaris loader for BepInEx (not the "original" Sybaris).
      

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by **this plugin**.
Good reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for issue reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest release of the plugin.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; make screenshots and save logs of the moment
   the problem occurs.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. 

In particular, we *always* want to know:

* What is the game you're using this plug-in with?
* What is the version of BepInEx you use?
* What did you do before the problem occurred?
